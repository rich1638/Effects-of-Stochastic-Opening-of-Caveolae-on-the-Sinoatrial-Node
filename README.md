# Effects-of-Stochastic-Opening-of-Caveolae-on-the-Sinoatrial-Node
We developed a mathematical model of the cardiac action potential in the sinoatrial node cells which include the effect of caveolae with stochastic opening times. The effects of the caveolae can be model through probability density functions. These probability density functions allow us to model the randomness of the opening and closing of the thousands of caveolae formed around the cell. Lastly, these results are compared with those of a previous mathematical model of stochastic caveolae opening development in a cardiomyocytes cell.
